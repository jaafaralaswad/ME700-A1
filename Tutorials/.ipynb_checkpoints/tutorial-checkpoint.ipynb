Also, in order to gurantee the existence of a root in the prescribed interval, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ must have different signs. If this was not the case, an error will appear. The user should deefine the maximum number of iterations, after which the proedure is terminated even if convergence is not obtained, and an error will appear."
